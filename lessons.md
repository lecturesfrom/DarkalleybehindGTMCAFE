# Lessons Learned — GTM Cafe_Raffle

Updated after every correction or discovered pattern.

## Project-Specific

- Admin role gate must protect BOTH page routes (`/admin/*`) and API routes (`/api/admin/*`). The original check `pathname.startsWith("/admin")` only caught pages; `/api/admin/users` starts with `/api/`, not `/admin`, so it bypassed the gate. For API routes, return 403 JSON; for page routes, redirect to dashboard.

### Auth.js v5 + Prisma + Edge Middleware: Two-File Pattern
**Problem**: PrismaClient is NOT edge-runtime compatible, but middleware runs on the edge.
**Solution**: Split into two files:
- `src/lib/auth.config.ts` — edge-safe: providers, JWT/session callbacks, session strategy. Used by middleware.
- `src/lib/auth.ts` — full server config: spreads authConfig + PrismaAdapter + signIn callbacks + events. Used by API routes and Server Components.
- `src/middleware.ts` imports `NextAuth(authConfig)` (NOT from auth.ts)

### Slack User ID is in `account.providerAccountId`
The `profile` object in Auth.js callbacks is the normalized provider profile. For Slack, `account.providerAccountId` is always the Slack user ID (`U1234567890`). Do not try to get it from `profile.sub` or `profile.user.id` — those may vary by scope.

### DB Credentials Stay in .env Only
**Never paste DATABASE_URL in chat.** The credential leaked into conversation history cannot be unlearned — rotate it immediately after any accidental exposure. The `.gitignore` already excludes `.env`, but the chat transcript is another leak vector.

### Next.js 14 Config Must Be .mjs
`next.config.ts` is NOT supported in Next.js 14.x — only Next.js 15+ added TypeScript config support. Always use `.mjs` or `.js`.

### API Route Stubs Need Valid Exports
Empty `.ts` route files with only comments or `export {}` will fail `next build` if they're in the `app/api/` directory and Next.js tries to verify them. Stubs need at least a minimal valid export like `export async function GET() {}`.

### JWT Strategy Required When Mixing Prisma Adapter + Middleware
With `adapter` set, Auth.js defaults to `database` sessions. You MUST explicitly set `session: { strategy: 'jwt' }` in `auth.config.ts` to enable JWT-based sessions — required for edge middleware to decode sessions without DB access.

### Notification System: Synchronous In-App + Best-Effort Slack DM
**Problem**: PRD/BACKEND_STRUCTURE said "queue contributor notification" but TECH_STACK says "no background job system".
**Resolution**: Notifications are synchronous:
1. In-app notification: Create `Notification` record immediately (primary, never lost)
2. Slack DM: Best-effort send after DB write — if it fails, catch + log, don't throw
This avoids the need for a job queue while ensuring contributors always get notified (at least in-app).

### Use Local Prisma Binary, Not npx
**Problem**: Running `npx prisma format` may fetch latest Prisma (v7.x) which has breaking changes (datasource `url` no longer in schema).
**Solution**: Use the local version: `./node_modules/.bin/prisma format` or run via npm scripts. The project pins Prisma 5.x.

## Architecture Decisions
- Slack OAuth is the ONLY auth method. No Google OAuth, no magic links. Slack workspace ID = membership gate.
- Activity check happens on first sign-in only, not on every login.
- Web app and Slack bot share the same backend — don't duplicate business logic.
- Raffle is simple random (ORDER BY random() LIMIT 1). No weighting, no round-robin in MVP.
- Contributors choose visibility at link submission time, not at raffle time.
- Notifications: in-app primary (DB), Slack DM secondary (best-effort, no queue needed for MVP).

## Git Workflow
- `main` is the single source of truth. All work merges into `main`.
- This laptop (local repo) is the canonical environment. Always reconcile here first, then push to GitHub.
- Start new work by branching off an up-to-date `main`: `git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b feature/...`
- Keep feature branches short-lived. Merge back into `main` as soon as a chunk of work is complete and tested.
- After merging, delete the feature branch locally (`git branch -d <branch>`) and remotely (`git push origin --delete <branch>`).
- Periodically run `git branch --merged main` to find and prune stale branches.
- Never force-push to `main` unless absolutely necessary and intentional.
- One remote only: `origin` → `https://github.com/lecturesfrom/DarkalleybehindGTMCAFE.git`

## General Patterns
- Always read CLAUDE.md and progress.txt at session start
- Reference canonical docs before implementing any feature
- Update progress.txt after completing each step
- Test on mobile after every UI change
- When in doubt, check the canonical doc — don't guess
- In middleware, evaluate status-based access rules before generic auth-route redirects to avoid redirect loops and dead branches
